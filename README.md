Detecting data elements using both visual and embedded text elements 
# ðŸŒ„ Natural Scene Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks
 Description
This project is focused on the classification of natural scene images into six categories: buildings, forest, glaciers, mountains and streets. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a condensed version of the Intel Image Classification Dataset and features a web interface built with streamlit.

How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
instal required libaries 
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you donâ€™t have a requirements.txt, manually install the major ones:
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn numpy matplotlib pillow streamlit
Train the model:
python train.py
launch the web app
streamlit run app.py
Then open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8501

Upload a .jpg image and it will predict which natural scene category it belongs to.
Model Performance (After 10 Epochs)
	â€¢	Training Accuracy: 83.18%
	â€¢	Validation Accuracy: 78.53%
	â€¢	Precision, Recall & F1-score: 80%â€“90%+ across all classes
